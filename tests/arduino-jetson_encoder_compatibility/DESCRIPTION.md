# Arduino-Jetson Motor Encoder Compatibility Test

These tests were performed to ensure a smooth transition from previous Arduino code to the newer Jetson Nano stack. In particular, it checked that the two systems read encoder pulses in the same way given the same PWM input.

To do this, we used the Arduino's `pulseIn()` function to get a ground-truth for the length of the encoder pulse resulting from a given PWM input driven by `analogWrite()`. To get data, we ran the motors for some time then put the encoder values in Excel to perform analysis. We then repeated the process on the Jetson, using [NVIDIA/jetson-gpio](https://github.com/NVIDIA/jetson-gpio) wherever possible and implementing our own functions (`pulseIn()`) as needed. We collected the same data for the motors on the Jetson and compared that to the data generated by the Arduino.
